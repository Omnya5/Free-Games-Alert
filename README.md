# Free-Games-Alert


Free Games Alert is a simple application which periodically check if a new game from Epic Game Store became free. 

Each week, Epic Games Store makes one non free-to-play game available for free. Information about which game is free this week is posted on: https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/free-games.

The Free-Game-Alert check which one is discounted this way and send a notification as a Slack message to inform the user about it.
